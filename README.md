# Next.js Dashboard

![Recording](https://github.com/randomdrake/nextjs-dashboard/blob/main/public/recording.gif?raw=true)

This is my implementation of the Next.js dashboard with some fixes and extras from the Next.js tutorial that can be found here:

[https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

It has everything the tutorial has plus:

* Customer page
* Customer search
* Avatar image / file upload handling with [Next.js blobs](https://vercel.com/storage/blob)
* Avatar icons throughout
* API usage / implementation
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* Date handling for invoices
* Fixes that the tutorial missed
* Clean up from the tutorial

Overall the tutorial was a great starter to get into the Next.js ecosystem but I felt like it deserves a part II. I was surprised it didn't get into file handling considering it's a new product they're offering. There were also code that didn't work or inconsistencies in the tutorial. I'm glad it left room for implementing more and didn't do everything for you, but I still feel like it could be improved.
